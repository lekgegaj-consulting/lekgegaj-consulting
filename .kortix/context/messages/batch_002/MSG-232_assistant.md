The issue is that `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` is not being recognized. Let me check the Next.js version and use a different approach - I'll disable static generation in next.config.js:

## Tool Calls
- **read_file** (id: `tooluse_gI5g5y70EUIGT9cdJn90mg`)
```json
{
  "file_path": "next.config.js"
}
```
