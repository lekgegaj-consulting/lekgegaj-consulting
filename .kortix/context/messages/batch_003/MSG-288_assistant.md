Perfect! I've created the GitHub OAuth connection. Here's what you need to do:

## 🔐 GitHub OAuth Authentication

**Click this link to authorize:**
👉 **[https://backend.composio.dev/api/v3/s/ZgElHXfT](https://backend.composio.dev/api/v3/s/ZgElHXfT)**

### What happens:
1. You'll be taken to GitHub's authorization page
2. You'll see a permission request from Kortix
3. **Permissions you'll grant:**
   - Read/write access to your repositories
   - Ability to push code
   - Manage repository contents
   - Create commits and branches

### On GitHub Mobile App:
If you're using the mobile app, you may be redirected to the browser. Look for:
- **"Authorize Kortix"** button
- **"Grant access"** button
- Confirm your GitHub password if prompted

### After Authorization:
1. You'll be redirected back to confirm success
2. Come back here and let me know you've completed it
3. I'll then push your project to the `lekgegaj-consulting` repository on the `main` branch

**No password needed** — OAuth handles everything securely.

Once you've authorized, just reply and I'll proceed with pushing your code! 🚀
