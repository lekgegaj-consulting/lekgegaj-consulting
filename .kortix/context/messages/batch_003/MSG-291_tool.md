{"message": "## Available Tools for GitHub\n\nFound **852 tools** available for lekgegaj-consulting GitHub:\n\n**1. GITHUB_ABORT_REPOSITORY_MIGRATION**\n   - Tool to abort a repository migration that is queued or in progress. Use when you need to cancel an ongoing migration operation.\n\n**2. GITHUB_ACCEPT_A_REPOSITORY_INVITATION**\n   - Accepts a PENDING repository invitation that has been issued to the authenticated user.\n\n**3. GITHUB_ADD_AN_EMAIL_ADDRESS_FOR_THE_AUTHENTICATED_USER**\n   - Adds one or more email addresses (which will be initially unverified) to the authenticated user's GitHub account; use this to associate new emails, noting an email verified for another account will error, while an existing email for the current user is accepted.\n\n**4. GITHUB_ADD_APP_ACCESS_RESTRICTIONS**\n   - Adds GitHub Apps to the list of apps allowed to push to a protected branch. The branch must already have protection rules with restrictions enabled. This endpoint only works for organization repositories, not personal repositories. Apps must be installed on the repository with 'contents' write permissions.\n\n**5. GITHUB_ADD_A_REPOSITORY_COLLABORATOR**\n   - Adds a GitHub user as a repository collaborator, or updates their permission if already a collaborator; `permission` applies to organization-owned repositories (personal ones default to 'push' and ignore this field), and an invitation may be created or permissions updated directly.\n\n**6. GITHUB_ADD_A_REPOSITORY_TO_AN_APP_INSTALLATION**\n   - Adds a repository to a GitHub App installation, granting the app access; requires authenticated user to have admin rights for the repository and access to the installation.\n\n**7. GITHUB_ADD_A_SELECTED_REPOSITORY_TO_A_USER_SECRET**\n   - Grants a specified repository access to an authenticated user's existing Codespaces secret, enabling Codespaces created for that repository to use the secret.\n\n**8. GITHUB_ADD_ASSIGNEES_TO_AN_ISSUE**\n   - Adds assignees to a GitHub issue. This action only adds users - it does not remove existing assignees. Changes are silently ignored if the authenticated user lacks push access to the repository.\n\n**9. GITHUB_ADD_FIELD_TO_USER_PROJECT**\n   - Tool to add a custom field to a user-owned GitHub Projects V2 project. Use when you need to add fields like status, priority, or custom data to organize project items.\n\n**10. GITHUB_ADD_ITEM_TO_USER_PROJECT**\n   - Tool to add an issue or pull request to a user-owned GitHub project. Use when you need to add existing repository items to a project board.\n\n**11. GITHUB_ADD_LABELS_TO_AN_ISSUE**\n   - Adds labels (provided in the request body) to a repository issue; labels that do not already exist are created.\n\n**12. GITHUB_ADD_ORG_RUNNER_LABELS**\n   - Adds new custom labels to an existing self-hosted runner for an organization; existing labels are not removed, and duplicates are not added.\n\n**13. GITHUB_ADD_OR_UPDATE_TEAM_MEMBERSHIP_FOR_A_USER**\n   - Adds a GitHub user to a team or updates their role (member or maintainer), inviting them to the organization if not already a member; idempotent, returning current details if no change is made.\n\n**14. GITHUB_ADD_OR_UPDATE_TEAM_PROJECT_PERMISSIONS**\n   - Adds a classic project to a team or updates the team's permission on it. This endpoint grants or updates permissions for a team on a specific classic project (not Projects V2). The authenticated user must have admin permissions for the project. Both the team and project must belong to the same organization. Requirements: - The project must be a classic project (not GitHub Projects V2) - The authenticated user must have admin permissions on the project - The team and project must be in the same organization - Requires 'admin:org' scope for the authentication token Returns HTTP 204 No Content on success, 403 if project is not an org project, or 404 if the organization, team, or project is not found.\n\n**15. GITHUB_ADD_OR_UPDATE_TEAM_REPOSITORY_PERMISSIONS**\n   - Sets or updates a team's permission level for a repository within an organization; the team must be a member of the organization.\n\n**16. GITHUB_ADD_REPO_TO_ORG_SECRET_WITH_SELECTED_ACCESS**\n   - Adds a repository to an existing organization-level GitHub Actions secret that is configured for 'selected' repository access.\n\n**17. GITHUB_ADD_REPO_TO_ORG_SECRET_WITH_SELECTED_VISIBILITY**\n   - Grants an existing repository access to an existing organization-level Dependabot secret when the secret's visibility is set to 'selected'; the repository must belong to the organization, and the call succeeds without change if access already exists.\n\n**18. GITHUB_ADD_RUNNER_LABELS**\n   - Adds and appends custom labels to a self-hosted repository runner, which must be registered and active.\n\n**19. GITHUB_ADD_SELECTED_REPOSITORY_TO_AN_ORGANIZATION_SECRET**\n   - Adds a repository to an organization secret's access list when the secret's visibility is 'selected'; this operation is idempotent.\n\n**20. GITHUB_ADD_SELECTED_REPOSITORY_TO_AN_ORGANIZATION_VARIABLE**\n   - Grants a repository access to an organization-level GitHub Actions variable, if that variable's visibility is set to 'selected_repositories'.\n\n**21. GITHUB_ADD_SOCIAL_ACCOUNTS_FOR_THE_AUTHENTICATED_USER**\n   - Adds one or more social media links (which must be valid, full URLs for platforms supported by GitHub) to the authenticated user's public GitHub profile.\n\n**22. GITHUB_ADD_STATUS_CHECK_CONTEXTS**\n   - Adds status check contexts to a protected branch's required status checks. This action appends new status check contexts to the existing list of required status checks for a protected branch. The branch must already have branch protection enabled with status checks configured. Note: The 'contexts' parameter is deprecated by GitHub in favor of 'checks' array. For new implementations, consider using update_status_check_protection with the 'checks' parameter instead.\n\n**23. GITHUB_ADD_SUB_ISSUE**\n   - Tool to add a sub-issue to a parent GitHub issue using GraphQL. Use when you need to establish a parent-child relationship between issues. Requires the 'sub_issues' GraphQL feature to be enabled.\n\n**24. GITHUB_ADD_TEAM_ACCESS_RESTRICTIONS**\n   - Adds teams to the list of teams with push access to a protected branch. This action grants additional teams push access to a protected branch. Unlike 'Set team access restrictions' (PUT), this action adds to the existing list rather than replacing it entirely. Prerequisites: - The repository must be owned by an organization (not a personal account) - The branch must have protection rules enabled - The branch protection must have restrictions configured - The teams must exist in the organization and have repository access\n\n**25. GITHUB_ADD_USER_ACCESS_RESTRICTIONS**\n   - Adds users to the list of people allowed to push to a protected branch in an organization repository. Important notes: - This action only works on organization-owned repositories (not personal repos) - The branch must already have protection rules with restrictions enabled - Users must have write access to the repository to be added - The combined total of users, apps, and teams is limited to 100 items\n\n**26. GITHUB_ADD_USERS_TO_CODESPACES_ACCESS_FOR_AN_ORGANIZATION**\n   - Adds organization members to the list of users granted Codespaces access billed to the organization. IMPORTANT: This endpoint requires the organization's Codespaces billing access to be set to 'selected_members' mode. If not already configured, use the GITHUB_MANAGE_ACCESS_CONTROL_FOR_ORGANIZATION_CODESPACES action first to set visibility to 'selected_members'.\n\n**27. GITHUB_API_ROOT**\n   - Retrieves a map of all top-level GitHub REST API resource URLs and their templates.\n\n**28. GITHUB_APPROVE_A_WORKFLOW_RUN_FOR_A_FORK_PULL_REQUEST**\n   - Approves a workflow run from a forked repository's pull request; call this when such a run requires manual approval due to workflow configuration.\n\n**29. GITHUB_ASSIGN_AN_ORGANIZATION_ROLE_TO_A_TEAM**\n   - Assigns an existing organization-level role (identified by `role_id`) to a team (identified by `team_slug`) within a GitHub organization (`org`), provided the organization, team, and role already exist.\n\n**30.

GITHUB_CLEAR_PROJECT_V2_ITEM_FIELD_VALUE**\n   - Tool to clear the value of a field for an item in a GitHub Project V2. Use when you need to remove or reset a field value (text, number, date, assignees, labels, single-select, iteration, or milestone fields).\n\n**52. GITHUB_CLEAR_REPOSITORY_CACHE_BY_KEY**\n   - Deletes GitHub Actions caches from a repository matching a specific `key` and an optional Git `ref`, used to manage storage or clear outdated/corrupted caches; the action succeeds even if no matching caches are found to delete.\n\n**53. GITHUB_CLEAR_SELF_HOSTED_RUNNER_ORG_LABELS**\n   - Removes all custom labels from a self-hosted runner for an organization; default labels (e.g., 'self-hosted', 'linux', 'x64') will remain.\n\n**54. GITHUB_COMMIT_MULTIPLE_FILES**\n   - Tool to atomically create, update, or delete multiple files in a GitHub repository as a single commit. Uses Git Data APIs to avoid SHA mismatch conflicts that occur with the Contents API when multiple files are modified in parallel. Use when you need to make multi-file changes reliably. BRANCH CREATION: When committing to a new branch (e.g., 'fix/my-fix' or 'feature/new-feature'), you MUST provide 'base_branch' (typically 'main' or 'master') to create the branch from. If the branch already exists, base_branch is not needed. This action handles race conditions automatically: if the branch is updated by another commit between fetching the HEAD and updating the reference (resulting in a 422 'not a fast forward' error), the action will retry by refetching the HEAD and rebasing changes. Use max_retries to control this behavior.\n\n**55. GITHUB_COMPARE_TWO_COMMITS**\n   - Compares two commit points (commits, branches, tags, or SHAs) within a repository or across forks, using `BASE...HEAD` or `OWNER:REF...OWNER:REF` format for the `basehead` parameter.\n\n**56. GITHUB_CONFIGURE_JITRUNNER_FOR_ORG**\n   - Generates a JIT configuration for a GitHub organization's new self-hosted runner to run a single job then unregister; requires admin:org scope and the runner_group_id must exist in the organization.\n\n**57. GITHUB_CONFIGURE_OIDCSUBJECT_CLAIM_TEMPLATE**\n   - Sets or updates the OIDC subject claim customization template for an existing GitHub organization by specifying which claims (e.g., 'repo', 'actor') form the OIDC token's subject (`sub`). This action customizes which claim keys are included in the OIDC subject claim for the specified organization. It allows for fine-tuning the content of the subject claim based on organizational needs.\n\n**58. GITHUB_CONVERT_AN_ORGANIZATION_MEMBER_TO_OUTSIDE_COLLABORATOR**\n   - Converts an existing organization member, who is not an owner, to an outside collaborator, restricting their access to explicitly granted repositories.\n\n**59. GITHUB_CREATE_A_BLOB**\n   - Creates a Git blob in a repository, requiring content and encoding ('utf-8' or 'base64'). Requires write access to the repository.\n\n**60. GITHUB_CREATE_A_CHECK_RUN**\n   - Creates a new check run for a specific commit in a repository, used by external services to report status, detailed feedback, annotations, and images directly within the GitHub UI. NOTE: This endpoint requires GitHub App authentication - OAuth tokens and personal access tokens cannot create check runs.\n\n**61. GITHUB_CREATE_A_CHECK_SUITE**\n   - Creates a new check suite for a specific commit (`head_sha`) in an original repository (not a fork). IMPORTANT: This endpoint requires a GitHub App installation access token - OAuth tokens and classic personal access tokens cannot use this endpoint. GitHub dispatches a `check_suite` webhook event with the `requested` action upon success.\n\n**62. GITHUB_CREATE_A_CODESPACE_FOR_THE_AUTHENTICATED_USER**\n   - Creates a GitHub Codespace for the authenticated user, requiring a JSON request body with either `repository_id` (integer) or a `pull_request` object (containing `pull_request_number` (integer) and `repository_id` (integer)). This action allows users to set up a development environment quickly by creating a codespace from a specified repository or pull request.\n\n**63. GITHUB_CREATE_A_CODESPACE_FROM_A_PULL_REQUEST**\n   - Creates a GitHub Codespace for an open pull request in a Codespaces-enabled repository, with options to customize its configuration.\n\n**64. GITHUB_CREATE_A_CODESPACE_IN_A_REPOSITORY**\n   - Creates a GitHub Codespace for the authenticated user in a specified repository, which must be accessible and use a valid `devcontainer.json` if `devcontainer_path` is specified.\n\n**65. GITHUB_CREATE_A_COMMIT**\n   - Creates a new commit in a GitHub repository; the `tree` SHA and any `parents` SHAs must already exist in the repository.\n\n**66. GITHUB_CREATE_A_COMMIT_COMMENT**\n   - Creates a comment on a specific commit, or on a specific line if `path` and `position` are provided.\n\n**67. GITHUB_CREATE_A_COMMIT_STATUS**\n   - Sets a commit's status (e.g., error, failure, pending, success from CI/CD) for a given SHA; max 1000 statuses per SHA/context.\n\n**68.
